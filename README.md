This web application allows a user to enter the item or items they would like to donate. The application then provides a list of donation sites, the items they accept, the location, and a map of the location. It also allows the user to add other donation sites.

The project features a MERN stack, with integration of [Leaflet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/leaflet) for rendering maps and a [Geocoding API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/start) by Google  to feed Leaflet the latitude and longitude of physical addresses.
